Cast info shows on TV series title page when Season Select is blank but we default to S1 so it's an unreachable state (also not present in dropdown). We need to change this to have Seasons 1-X (including any .5 seasons in-between if relevant idk) in seasons dropdown, season 1 selected default and nothing other than 1-X avail. Then next to it an Extras dropdown that has any Specials, S0s, other outliers, and Cast. Cast pulls that cast info list as a page, then uses RD Api to pull list of movies for that cast member as a new page, sorted both by recency rating and any other popularity or billing (i.e. lead costar etc) relevant in new search page with Actor pic, name, bio as though it were another title page. Each movie / tv show listed is clickable for its title page to play it.
